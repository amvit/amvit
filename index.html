        <p id="para">Activities like bowling, running between the wickets, wicket-keeping, batting and fielding require a lot of physical movement. I have made so many friends while playing cricket. Cricket encourages teamwork. I think cricket is much better than sitting hours in front of the computer screen or playing video games.1) Cricket is a game played with bat and ball having 11 players on each side of the two teams. 2) The person who hits the ball is called “Batsman”, another person who bowls is called “Bowler”. 3) The aim of the two teams is to restrict the opponent in less runs while bowling and make maximum runs while batting.Cricket is my favorite hobby and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started playing cricket when I was a kid of 7 years old.</p>
